    "For the benign instructions, after applying DPO combined with a utility augmented objective, the tuned model demonstrated improved utility. Specifically, for benign queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original Model: 317 examples; 87 classified as “yes” (27.44% helpful).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuned Model: 317 examples; 138 classified as “yes” (43.53% helpful).\n",
    "\n",
    "It appears that fine-tuning with a benign instructional dataset has increased the model’s utility — likely by reducing the frequency of automatic refusals that can lower overall usefulness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simultaneously, for harmful instructions, the harmfulness statistics were promising:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original Model: 303 examples; 229 flagged as harmful (75.58%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuned Model: 303 examples; 182 flagged as harmful (60.07%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we observe roughly a +15% increase in utility for benign instructions and about a 15% decrease in harmfulness on our synthetic datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, when increasing the number of training epochs from 10 to 20, the alignment effectiveness improved noticeably, as indicated by a consistent decrease in the loss values. This suggests that training for 20+ epochs could further reduce harmful responses, although careful monitoring of utility loss is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that when finetuning off DPO only, our harmfulness rate decreased to 0-10% but our utility on benign prompts were met with a steep dropoff - balancing these seems important.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the token attribution experiments, we observed that after DPO tuning the model became more sensitive to unsafe or sensitive phrases. For example, tokens like \"fake\" and \"private\" were highlighted in red in our toy examples for harmful queries. Conversely, for benign instructions, these markers were no longer prominent after fine-tuning. This indicates that the model is now better able to detect contextual clues associated with harmful content and respond accordingly—while benign queries do not trigger these warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these changes in the token attribution distributions suggest that the tuned model demonstrates a more balanced behavior: it becomes more discerning about detecting harmful content and more forgiving on benign queries compared to the original model.\n",
